Hi and welcome to team HamaraBasket.com . As you know, we are a small online retail shop, we buy from local sources and sell you the best products.

            - All items have a SellBy value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item
            - All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
            - At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item

Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:

            - Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
            - The Quality of an item is never negative
            - "Indian Wine" actually increases in Quality the older it gets
            - The Quality of an item is never more than 50
            - "Forest Honey", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
            - "Movie Tickets ", like Indian Wine, increases in Quality as its SellBy value approaches;
            Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but
            Quality drops to 0 after the Show.
            - " Fresh fruits and Vegetables‚Äù degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items
